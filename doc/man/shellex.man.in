== NAME

shellex - shell-based launcher

== SYNOPSIS

*shellex* [...]

== OPTIONS

All command-line parameters (together with some shellex-specific) are passed on
to urxvt. This means, you can you e.g. '-bg grey20' for a lighter background.
Using it for more than just customizing the appearence (for example adding own
extensions) might stop shellex from working, so be careful.

See urxvt(1) for a full list of options.

== DESCRIPTION

*shellex* is a shell-based launcher with a lot more features and a lot simpler
design. It launches a shell (currently zsh(1)) and shows it in a small
terminal (currently urxvt(1)), wrapping every command with a little bit of
extra magic (redirecting stdout, stderr, disowning and closing the shell) to
get more typical launcher-behaviour.

This gives you a simple launcher with tab-completion and other shell-features,
configurable in shell.

== RESOURCES

*shellex* uses two X-Resources at the monent, to manipulate its behaviour:

URxvt.shellex.pos::
If pointer, shellex shows the window on the window, the mousepointer is on. If
focus, it uses the output, where most of the currently focused window is.
Defaults to focus.

URxvt.shellex.edge::
On what screen edge to show the launcher (top or bottom). Defaults to top.

== CONFIGURATION

*shellex* configuration snippets can be found in *@PREFIX@@LIBDIR@/shellex/*.

On start, *shellex* looks into @SYSCONFDIR@/shellex for default-snippets to
source (usually this will be symlinks to *@PREFIX@@LIBDIR@/shellex/*) as well
as into *$HOME/.shellex/* for any user-configuration. If a file of the same
name exists in both locations, it will only use the one in *$HOME/.shellex/*.

To customize shellex, you can do the following things in *$HOME/.shellex/*:

1. Overwrite a default by creating a new snippet of the same name
2. Not include a default by creating a symlink to */dev/null* of the same same
3. Include an example-snippet not used by default, by creating a symlink to *@PREFIX@@LIBDIR@/shellex/snippet*
4. Write you own snippets with a currently unused name

To avoid naming-conflicts in the future, you should add a common suffix to all
your own snippets.
