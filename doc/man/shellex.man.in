== NAME

shellex - shell-based launcher

== SYNOPSIS

*shellex* [...]

== OPTIONS

All command-line parameters (together with some shellex-specific) are passed on
to urxvt. This means, you can you e.g. '-bg grey20' for a lighter background.
Using it for more than just customizing the appearance (for example adding own
extensions) might stop shellex from working, so be careful.

See urxvt(1) for a full list of options.

== DESCRIPTION

*shellex* is a shell-based launcher with a lot more features and a lot simpler
design. It launches a shell (currently zsh(1)) and shows it in a small
terminal (currently urxvt(1)), wrapping every command with a little bit of
extra magic (redirecting stdout, stderr, disowning and closing the shell) to
get more typical launcher-behaviour.

This gives you a simple launcher with tab-completion and other shell-features,
configurable in shell.

== RESOURCES

*shellex* uses two X-Resources at the moment, to manipulate its behaviour:

shellex.pos::
If pointer, shellex shows the window on the window, the mousepointer is on. If
focus, it uses the output, where most of the currently focused window is.
Defaults to focus.

shellex.edge::
On what screen edge to show the launcher (top or bottom). Defaults to top.

Additionally all resources defined by urxvt (with class 'shellex' instead of
'urxvt') can be used to customize the appearance or behaviour of the used
terminal window.

== CONFIGURATION

*shellex* configuration snippets can be found in *@PREFIX@@LIBDIR@/shellex/*.

On start, *shellex* assembles a list of snippet basenames by looking at all of
the paths listed below. For each snippet basename, *shellex* loads the first
file it finds when looking through the paths in order:

1. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.shellex. Typically unset, defaulting to $HOME/.config/shellex.
2. $HOME/.shellex
3. @SYSCONFDIR@/shellex (shellex defaults, symlinks to *@PREFIX@@LIBDIR@/shellex/conf/*)

To customize shellex, you can do the following things in
*$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.shellex* or *$HOME/.shellex/*:

1. Overwrite a default by creating a new snippet of the same name
2. Not include a default by creating a symlink to */dev/null* of the same same
3. Include an example-snippet not used by default, by creating a symlink to *@PREFIX@@LIBDIR@/shellex/snippet*
4. Write you own snippets with a currently unused name

To avoid naming-conflicts in the future, you should add a common suffix to all
your own snippets. Snippets are run in ascending order. By choosing a number
which sorts between/after the existing snippet(s) you can ensure it runs at the
desired time. E.g. if your snippet beeps on errors, name it 15-errorbeep so that
it sorts before 20-nobeep.
